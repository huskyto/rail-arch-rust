# Simulator for the Simple 8-bit Rail Architecture

This project is a simulator for the simple 8-bit Rail architecture. The Rail architecture is not intended to be a serious architecture and was created just for fun and learning purposes.

The simulator is implemented in Rust, and as I'm still learning the language, it might lack best practices and might not be idiomatic Rust code. The Rust implementation is based on a previous Kotlin implementation.
